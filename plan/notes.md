# Dropdle - the Daily Block Drop game



## Milestones
- [ ] Chart out plan timeline and milestones
- [ ] Get a site up and running

### Charter
- starting in earnest Feb 22nd, Sunday
- that gives, 14 weeks to complete everything
- Or, 7 sprints of standard size
- Let's have sprints start on Sunday and be 7 days long - but probably only work on the game 3~ days a week
  - Sunday planning, initial coding
- Do a lot of work on Monday
  - Eiosti streaming, first day of work week, should be pretty straightforward
- And review on Saturday, re-evaluate
- This gives us 14 blocks of time to figure out what we want to do
